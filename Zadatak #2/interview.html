Greetings,
My name is Adnan Nukic and I think that I have required skills for the job you offer.
I have gradueted in December at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Tuzla on power grids and systems.
Then I got the opportunity to work at JU MSS Zivinice from 10.February to 30.June as professor and two months at LED Vision d.o.o as developing engineer back in 2021.
The skills I possess are very diverse.
They differ from ones like driving ability, through various programs and computer skills, to those communication skills.
For example, the programs I know are: Microsoft office, PSS/e, DIALux, RELUX, Nitro, Adobe Photoshop & Gimp, Multisim, Logixpro, AutoCAD (basics) and those that are fresh HTML & CSS and JavaScript. 
I have interests in areas such as software programming, economics, energy, politics, psychology, sports and fitness.
I am a good team worker, totally ready to work in a good team atmosphere in your company.
I am ready for all tasks, field work, work from home, extended work and work on call.
With these skills I think I can contribute to this company, give my maximum and commitment more than other candidates.
With due respect, Adnan.
